# Kitaev.jl

Kitaev.jl is a high-performance framework for tensor network simulations of the Kitaev honeycomb model and its variants. Built on the powerful [ITensors.jl](https://docs.itensor.org/ITensors/stable/) library, this package provides robust tools for exploring a wide range of physical phenomena. Key features include:

- Mapping narrow cylinders to matrix product states (MPS)
- Support for anisotropic Kitaev interactions, Heisenberg interactions, \(\gamma\) terms, and nonmagnetic spin vacancies
- Tailored perturbations and pinning fields to aid in achieving convergence

This project is actively evolving, with additional features and enhancements under development.
